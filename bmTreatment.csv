Joints were hammered to secure. The edges of the scroll were cut and turned in, the seam being adhered using thick aged paste and hammered to secure.

This was lined using a weak wheat starch paste adhesive. The lined silk was then toned to a level of colour lighter than the original. Each repair was copied onto tracing paper and cut out of the lined repair silk. The repair was adhered using a mixture of new starch paste and funori (seaweed adhesive) 50:50. Once in place the support paper was moistened using water and removed from the face of the silk repair. The whole repair is then lightly moistened to allow the repair to pull down into place. On drying the silk repair is brushed with soy milk 5% prior to toning with artists water colour to a neutral colour.

The Plastazote layers were attached to an Aerolam F board (glass fibre, epoxy laminate on aluminium honeycomb) base of appropriate dimensions, which had been covered with a taut layer of cotton lawn, adhered usingVinamul 3252 (polyvinyl acetate, ethylene copolymer). Layers of polyester wadding were placed inside the recess, to match the contours of the reverse side of the portrait.

A colour-matched card frame was cut with an aperture the same size as the portrait. The edges of the aperture were bevelled, with the bevelled edge facing inwards so that the white core of the card was not visible. The card frame was strengthened by an additional piece of card adhered to the reverse. Shaped Plastazote pieces, tinted using acrylic paints, were attached to the reverse of the card to hold in place the top and bottom edges of the portrait.

The polythene was removed and the poultice allowed to evaporate for 1-2 hours. The poultice and Bondina were then removed from the textile allowing the net to be removed without friction.

All the internal surfaces were then lined with aluminium foil, taking care to eliminate any undercuts. The edges were bent over the rim of the mask. Cut sections of parcel tape were applied to all areas of the aluminium foil making sure that there were no pin-holes left uncovered. Aluminium tape was used to re-inforce the edges of the mask. A wall of foil was then built along the rim of the mask to prevent any overflow of resin from seeping onto the painted surfaces. This was also re-inforced with aluminium tape and parcel tape. All of these surfaces were coated in lascaux wax (microcrystalline wax, synthetic polyterpene) A mixture of foaming epoxy resin: Araldite CW 2215 resin, Hardner HY 5161 and foaming agent DY 5054 was made up in the following proportions: R.100gx H 20gx F 2g. This was poured into the prepared mask. NB. The foaming agent was doubled in order to make the mount lighter. Once set, the mount was removed from the mask and 'shaped' using abrasive papers and a combination of files. Holes etc. were filled with 20% Paraloid B72 (ethyl methacrylate co polymer) in acetone /industrial methylated spirits and microballoons ( silica or phenilic resin). Scoops were cut out from the back of the mount to facilitate handling. The mount was then painted to an acceptable colour for the mask."
