http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x14728,Base Ring Ware,"Base Ring (BR) ware is a distinctive hand-made pottery type from Late Bronze Age Cyprus, one of the three main wares (along with White Slip and Monochrome) that that are found all over the island in this period, particularly from LCII (ca. 1450/1400 BC) onwards when earlier local MC traditions give way to a more uniform ceramic industry. Base Ring ware is characterised by a thin, highly fired, metallic fabric which is black, grey, brown or red-orange in colour (often with a grey core). It probably originated in the north-west of the island, and spread from there over the course of LCI, though it occurs on the south coast at sites such as Maroni within the same period. Major shapes include small juglets with poppy-shaped heads, larger jugs, small storage jars, bowls with wish-bone handles, tankards and specially-shaped pouring vessels (‘rhytons’ or ‘askoi’) in the shape of animals such as bulls. Base Ring ware is also commonly found as exports in surrounding regions of the Eastern Mediterranean; the poppy-shaped juglets in particular may have been valued for their contents, possibly containing medicinal compounds such as opiates. Three principal varieties of the ware are recognised, which vary in terms of fabrics, techniques, shapes and decorations, though the exact boundary between these groups is debated: Proto-Base Ring ware (PBR) appears at the beginning of the Late Cypriot period in LCIA, somewhat coarser in fabric, and less standardised in shape and technique, than Base Ring I; despite the name, it is debated how much earlier (if at all) PBR is than Base Ring I, or indeed if it is merely a formative stage of this type. Base Ring I (BR I) is characterised in particular by relief decoration and is particularly common during Late Cypriot I but also continuing into Late Cypriot II. Base Ring II (BR II), which is usually less well made than BR I, has white painted decoration on its surface in place of relief, and is generally later (LCIB-II) though the successive numerals do not imply any strict chronological should not be understood as . A wheel-made variety appears towards the end of the Late Cypriot period, under the influence of imported Aegean fabrics and locally made wheel-made wares. Some BR shapes are imitated by Mycenaean potters towards the end of LCII Bibliography: P. Åström The Swedish Cyprus Expedition Vol. IV/1C (Lund, 1972), pp. 126-197. P. Åström ed.

To date, ‘Official’ Jun wares have only been found at one kiln site near the Juntai terrace, inside the north gate of the administrative seat of Yuzhou prefecture. ‘Official’ Jun wares were made in the early Ming period (about AD 1368 to 1435). They are also called ‘Numbered’ Jun because they bear Chinese numbers incised on their bases. These numbers range from one to ten. Their forms are limited to flower pots and their saucers, shallow bulb bowls with studs and bronze-inspired vases. Unlike earlier Song, Jin and Yuan Jun wares, ‘Official’ Jun wares have not been found in tombs but are included in the former palace collections, suggesting they were only made for court use in the Ming dynasty."

http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x14822,White Slip Ware,"White Slip (WS) ware is a distinctive hand-made pottery type from Late Bronze Age Cyprus, one of the three main wares (along with Base Ring and Monochrome) that that are found all over the island in this period, particularly from LCII (ca. 1450/1400 BC) onwards when earlier local MC traditions give way to a more uniform ceramic industry. All WS vessels are hand-made from fairly fine, but sometimes gritty, clay, over which is put a thick white, cream or buff slip, fired to temperatures in excess of 1000° C. The surface is decorated in dark (usually black, brown or red) paint: common motifs include parallel lines, hatched bands, ladders, rows of lozenges, wavy lines, and lines of dots. Rare examples of pictorial decoration are also attested. Major shapes include hemispherical bowls with wish-bone handles (‘milk bowls’), small juglets similar in form to Base Ring poppy-shaped juglets, and larger jugs and ‘craters’ (that is, bowls), and bottles. The shapes suggest that WS wares were mostly used for eating and drinking rather than storage or cooking. WS wares were exported to the surrounding regions of the Eastern and Central Mediterranean in large quantities. This ware is commonly divided into categories according to technique, shape and decoration: Proto White Slip is a formative phase owing much to older Middle Cypriot White Painted wares; White Slip I marks the technical and artistic peak of the fabric type; White Slip IIA seems to be a regional variant of WS I; White Slip II. The latter type is more standardised and mass produced than WS I, showing a marked decline in quality towards the end of the ware’s life in LCIIC-IIIA (13th and 12th centuries BC), sometimes called White Slip Late in the archaeological literature. The chronology of the WS continues to be problematic, as few stratified sequences exist sowing the full development of the ware. M. Popham ‘White Slip ware’ in P.

They were traded to countries in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia, the Phillipines and Malaysia as well as to Japan and Holland. They are characterised by coarse sandy bases and were made with underglaze blue, overglaze enamel and slip decoration on a single coloured ground."
