http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x5109,aeolipile,"An alternative name for these is sphero-conical vessels. The function of this very distinctive class of container has attracted many different opinions since the early nineteenth century. They have been interpreted as containers for mercury, fire-blowers (aeolipiles), grenades for containing Greek fire, flasks for containing fizzy alcohol or other liquids, holy water bottles or even lamps, loom-weights or decorative finials used in architecture. They have a very wide distribution stretching from Spain to Central Asia, date between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and were made in many different workshops. Whereas most are made of high-fired pottery, some were made of metal and glass. For more information, see: R. Ettinghausen, “The uses of sphero-conical vessels in the Muslim East”, ‘Journal of Near Eastern Studies’, 24/3 (July 1965), pp.218-229."

They have been found across broad areas of Asia and the Middle East as they were used along maritime trade routes. The first mention of the name ‘Martaban jar’ is found in an Arab traveller’s writings from 1350, but the jars were probably in use much earlier than this. The name ‘Martaban jar’ probably arose because Martaban was once a major Burmese port for Indian Ocean trade. However, the jars were not necessarily made in the area, and there is evidence that they came from up-country in Burma, as well as Thailand."

The term 'writing-tablet' is used for tablets with inscriptions, usually made of wood but also sometimes of other materials such as copper alloy, ivory, etc. Where they contain multiple pages, they may be hinged. There are two varieties: 1) stilus-tablets, on which the writing was incised with a pointed stilus into a layer of wax recessed into the wooden tablet. 2) leaf-tablets, which were thin slices of wood inscribed in ink with a pen. The so-called ‘Vindolanda Tablets’ are in fact writing-tablets."
