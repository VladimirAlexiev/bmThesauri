http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x22966,Abbasid dynasty,"749-1258 (AH 132-AH 923). Dynasty ruling the Muslim world as caliphs with Iraq at it's centre and Baghdad it's capital. The Abbasids derived from the family of the Prophet Muhammad's uncle al-'Abbas and the Meccan clan of Hashim. The Abbasids were influenced by older Persian traditions of divine rulership. The Abbasid revolution, while in origin an Arab movement, began on Persian soil and took advantage of discontent in the Persian lands. The shifting of the capital from Damascus under the Umayyads to Baghdad in Iraq symbolised a new eastward orientation of the caliphate with increasingly evident Persian material and cultural practives of the next centuries. The Abbasid caliphs adopted honorific titles expressing divine support for their rule. The first three centuries of Abbasid rule saw the full flowering of medieval Islamic civilisation and influences coming in from Persia and the Hellenistic and Byzantine cultures. The Abbasid ruler best known in the West is Harun al-Rashid (786-809 AH 170-193), who is associated with the stories of 1001 Nights."

The term was originally defined after the Renaissance by the literary and artistic inheritance of Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries BC and Rome between the first century BC and fourth century AD, but later took on a broader meaning including history, material culture, settlement and economy within much wider chronological and geographical parameters. The term also includes cultures in close proximity to or in contact with Greeks and Romans, such as Cyprus, the non-Greek peoples of Anatolia such as Lycians and Carians, and the Villanovan, Etruscan and Italic communities of Italy. Other cultures, such as Phoenicians and Carthaginians, local peoples of Spain and North Africa (including Dynastic Egypt), Phrygians, Thracians, Scythians, Celts and the Germanic tribes tend to be included under other Top Terms in the thesaurus (Prehistoric, Levantine and Middle Eastern periods and cultures, and Historic European Periods and cultures).

These assemblages were used by hunter-gatherers and show few changes in content or technology from the preceding Upper Palaeolithic period except in the greater numbers of backed blades, crescents and microliths. This similarity gives rise to the term epi (like)-palaeolithic. In northern Europe, environmental change was much greater at the end of the Ice Age, human adaptations changed in response and, consequently, the stone artefact assemblages are much different from those of the Upper Palaeolithic and are distinguished as Mesolithic. Despite this distinction the terms Epi-palaeolithic and Mesolithic are occasionally used as if synonymous."

http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x117615,Ice Age,"The Ice Age refers to the period between 2.6 million and 11,700 years ago during which climate varied through alternating warm and cold periods. Modern humans and many other mammal species evolved during this period. During some cold stages (glaciations) temperatures dropped so much that continental and alpine ice sheets spread over vast areas. With water frozen to ice, sea levels also dropped providing humans and animals with opportunities to spread out across land bridges which were then submerged again during warm periods such as we live in today. Throughout the Ice Age, Britain formed part of mainland of Europe. However, 'Ice Age' (as used in the British Museum records) is a term in popular use for the period of warm and cold phases between 126,000 and 11,000 years ago or, more narrowly, to the time after 40,000 years ago when fully modern humans arrived in Europe and North America. The Pleistocene is a geological term used to refer to the same period of climatic changes as the Ice Age. The Last Ice Age refers to the period of warm and cold phases between 126,000 and c.11, 000 years ago when fully modern people like us (Homo sapiens sapiens) spread around the earth."

The Indo-Greeks lost Afghanistan and most of Pakistan to Indo-Scythians c. 70 BC, but survived in the Punjab until c. AD 10. They are the successors to the Greco-Bactrians, who broke away from the Seleucid empire c. 250 BC to form an independent Greek kingdom in Bactria (Afghanistan north of the Hindu Kush) and Sogdiana (modern Tajikistan), which was lost to nomadic tribes of the Indo-Scythians and Yuezhi by c. 100 BC."
http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x113048,Indo-Parthian,"The term refers to a culture from c. 1stC to 3rdC AD. Knowledge of the so-called Indo-Parthians derives largely from coins and a few inscriptions. Some of the names and coin designs suggest links with the Parthians of Iran, but the precise relationship is not clear. In the first century AD the Indo-Parthians seem to have gained control of the region stretching from the Punjab, Sind and Gandhara (north-west Pakistan) to Seistan (south-east Iran). The principal ruler is Gondophares (c. AD 32–60). The title ‘Gondophares’ (Old Persian Vindapharna ‘Winner of Glory’) was adopted by his successors in addition to their given names on coins from Arachosia (Qandahar) and the Punjab. However, in Sind and Seistan they also issued coins in their own right as ‘king’ or ‘king of kings’. This suggests a complex situation of rulers and sub-rulers who owed varying degrees of allegiance to the Indo-Parthian king."

Major settlements, such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, were laid out on a grid pattern with drainage and were clearly organised by a central power. The earliest fragments of woven cotton from the subcontinent come from these sites. Trade with sites in the Persian Gulf, as well as with settlements on the Oxus, has been substantiated."

From 301-201BC most of ancient Judaea was under Ptolemaic control; it was then under the Seleucids under Antiochus III Megas. By 40BC Judaea was almost entirely dominated by Rome, and the first king of the Herodian dynasty, Herod I, was appointed by a declaration of the Roman Senate. Coins minted under the Roman Prefects of Judaea ('the Procurators') have the period culture 'Roman Provincial', as do the later imperial coins minted in Judaean cities (e.g. Aelia Capitolina, the new Roman Jerusalem). The term is not used for the collections in the Department of Greek and Roman. If the object dates to the period before Judaea became a Roman province (about 6AD) the term 'Hellenistic' is used, and if after Rome takes over then the term 'Roman' is used."

The name is derived from a site on Lake Neuchâtel, Switzerland, where the first 'La Tène' type objects were excavated in the late 19thC. In addition to describing a broad chronological timeframe, the term La Tène is also used to refer to certain types of object characteristic of this period, for example a La Tène sword or brooch. La Tène can be subdivided into La Tène I, II and III, or La Tène A, B, C and D. Using these subdivisions well established typologies of La Tène objects have been created. For example, the attachment of the foot to the bow on La Tène brooches follows a pattern which is consistent over time and across much of Europe. For example, the foot of a La Tène I brooch is not attached to the bow. If a brooch of this type is discovered it is an important piece of dating evidence for other types of object."

Other important fabrics included Bichrome Wheelmade, Red Lustrous Wheelmade and various Plain and Painted Wheelmade wares; the latter are heavily influenced by imports from the Mycenaean world in particular (but also the Levant) which gradually displace the older hand-made wares by the 12th century. The period is characterised by a thriving copper extraction industry, intense commercial interchange with surrounding regions – with imports visible from all around the Eastern Mediterranean - , and the emergence of more complex forms of social organisation, which can be called towns by LCIIC and LCIIIA. Literacy is attested in the form of documents written in a script called Cypro-Minoan, which has some links with Bronze Age Crete. The last phase of the LC period, LCIII is a transitional period marked by major changes in the settlement pattern, burial practices, economy and material culture (including pottery types); the development of Proto-White Painted and Proto-Bichrome wares signal the beginning of the Iron Age in ceramic terms. The development of iron-making technology, in which Cypriot metallurgists played a leading role, develops apace at this time."

However, ‘Mycenaean’ continues to be used to describe Late Bronze Age Greek material culture, particularly that relating to the palatial era, when sites such as Mycenae flourished. The term 'Mycenaean' is used in preference to ‘Late Helladic’. Where a specific 'Late Helladic' sub-division term (such as 'Late Helladic I') can be defined, particularly in the case of pottery, the specific sub-division term should be used instead of 'Mycenaean'."

Perhaps the most famous king of the dynasty is his son Nebuchadnezzar, who in 598 BC captured Jerusalem and deported some of the population -- an event immortalised in the Bible. After a long and illustrious reign Nebuchadnezzar II died in 562 BC, to be followed by a series of kings with very short reigns.

The sultanate of the Great Seljuqs was based on a hierarchically organised state in the Perso-Islamic monarchic system, with the supreme sultan supported by a Perian and Arab beaurocracy and a multi-national army directed by Turkish slave commanders. Under Alp Arslan and his son Malik Shah the Great Seljuq empire reached its zenith and Isfahan was the capital.

The Seljuqs of Rum were an offshoot of the Great Seljuqs. After Alp Arslan's victory over the Byzantines, one of the descendants of one of the sons established a local Seljuq sultanate in Anatolia. The Latin conquest of Constantinople in 1204 (AH 600) gave the Seljuqs and oppurtunity to reestablish their power and extend their influence to the Mediterranean. With this and control over northern coastlands a flourishing transit trade developed between Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean across Anatolia to the Black Sea, the Crimea and the lands of the Mongol Golden Hoard. After circa 1225 commercial relations began with Italian trading cities."

They were the dominant merchants, their language became the lingua franca of the Silk Road, and they played an important role not only in trade but also in the spread of philosophies and religions, such as Manichaeism and Buddhism, to the east."

It refers to an area roughly equivalent to modern Gloucestershire, Avon and western Oxfordshire, parts and parts of Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire and Somerset.

The earliest coins were issued anonymously; later examples carry inscriptions that are assumed to be the names of local rulers. These include BODVOC, CORIO, COMVX, CATTI, ANTED and EISV. The ethnic or tribal identities of these issuers are unclear, but some may have belonged to the Dobunni who inhabited a similar area in the early Roman period.
